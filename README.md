# Overview

This project was to give me a better understanding of what GIS Mapping is and what it can do. I had a lot of fun making this map. This project is a map of Rexburg Idaho. Rexbug Idaho is home to a small university called Brigham Young Unvirsity-Idaho. It is a university that pulls students from all over the world. This map is designed to help the students unfamiliar with Rexburg. Listing more than 20 points of interest, new students can see some of the places to shop eat or have fun.

# Development Environment

ArcGIS
Visual Studio Code
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

# Useful Websites

* [ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/get-started/) At first glance the website can be kind of hard to get around. If you can find the right tutorials they are great!

# Future Work

* It would be really cool if the user could add their own points and descriptions.
* Expanding the project to showcase more of what Rexburg has to offer.
* Add more content to the website other than just the map.
